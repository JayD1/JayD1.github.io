I am a Dual Degree student at IIIT Hyderabad working under the guidance of [Dr. Pawan Kumar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pawan.kumar/myhomepage/) for my MS thesis.

My research interests are Riemannian Optimization, Optimization for Large-Scale Machine Learning, Low-Rank Tensor Completion, Embedding methods to Extreme-Classification, Convex Analysis, Variational Analysis, Saddle-point problems and Numerical Linear Algebra. 

For my MS thesis, I have worked on the applications of Riemannian Optimization to Machine learning problems - Extreme Classification and Low-Rank Tensor Completion.
